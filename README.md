## Noise Implementations & Attribution

This repository includes several procedural noise implementations, each with academic and open-source origins:

- **Flow Noise**: Based on Perlin & Neyret (2001).
- **Improved Perlin Noise**: Based on Ken Perlin’s improved algorithm (2002) and open-source implementations 
  by Stefan Gustavson and others.
- **Curl Noise**: Based on Robert Bridson’s “Curl-Noise for Procedural Fluid Flow” ([SIGGRAPH 2007](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph2007-curlnoise.pdf)).

See the source files and comments for detailed attribution.
